# Haskell implementation of the teal programming language

This is an experimental haskell implementation of the teal compiler.
[Teal](https://condense9.com) is a programming language for building stateful and portable serverless applications. Check out the original implementation [here](https://github.com/condense9/teal-lang).

Maybe in the future this includes the core features of teal but as it stands, this implementation is just a playground for experimenting with different programming language design concepts.
